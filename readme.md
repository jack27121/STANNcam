# About
STANNcam is a camera and resolution manager system for GameMaker-LTS (and onwards)  
It foregoes gamemakers viewports and application_surface,  
and instead gives full control on where and in which order to draw your different camera's contents to the screen.

# Features
* Ability to add/clone/remove up to 8 cameras at runtime easily
* Camera following options
* Functions for moving/zooming/shaking the camera
* Independent game and GUI resolution (can be identical as well)
* Change display resolution, fullscreen, keep aspect-ratio. at runtime
* Ability to draw camera contents directly on an object in a level (can be used for TV/Monitor/portal effects)
* Easily apply shaders to everything drawn
* Draw stuff before and after the camera is drawn (useful for dynamic backgrounds/foregrounds)
